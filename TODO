* Fix complex init sequence

At init, error needs pth and log, and conf needs error, and log_begin needs 
errors !
Also, to init the log we need to get the conf envvar telling us where to write 
log messages.

Code a simplier init function the init pth, error, log and conf altogether.

* A console chat client for the Chat protocol

* SNMP counters

* A Stribution client

- independant of vadrouille so that you need only one conf, and it can access 
  all of a user folders (hint : beware of loops). One daemon for all users, 
configured by patches that a user put in the directory where he can write 
(these must be authentified, so mdsyncd definitively needs to add username to
all submited patches - addition or removal).
