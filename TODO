* Fix complex init sequence

At init, error needs pth and log, and conf needs error, and log_begin needs 
errors !
Also, to init the log we need to get the conf envvar telling us where to write 
log messages.

Code a simplier init function the init pth, error, log and conf altogether.

* A console chat client for the Chat protocol

* A merePIM

* smtpd should unencode message content if encoded

* smtpd must read all users tosend box and try to send it (to a single relay) then del and put them to users send box.

* smtp messages should name the resource (using the sc-name field ? Or maybe using two parameters to the resource field, url and name - and use this as well for merefs resources)

* A mereNotifier fed by mdsyncc (from a pipe)
