<h2>Simple Communication and Messaging through Basic Input/Output</h2>
<h3>What is this about ?</h3>
<p>
	More and more people are using more and more devices across more and more
	networks.  We carry out business laptop to home and access documents through
	local private wired network, public wireless network or telco's GSM network,
	using many kind of user interface.

</p><p>
	But we try to do all this with yesterday's protocols, which were somewhat
	based on the assumption that users were bound to a host, equiped with a
	single operating system and belonging to a given LAN. We then have to work
	this around by juggling with severall identities, configuring many gateways,
	proxies, adapting one protocol to another. This is all unified messaging is
	about : building complex machinery to have email, VoIP and sometimes instant
	messaging working together. This is also what's behind IMS.

</p><p>
	This situation may be improved if one is ready to depart from casual protocols.
