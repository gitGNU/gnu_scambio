/* The custom list for calendar is... a calendar, with a list per day.
 * The other special behaviour is that we try to have only one calendar
 * window ; when we are asked for a new dir_list we merely add the folder
 * to the global calendar window (also, this calendar display a list of
 * folders currently displayed (used to remove a folder from the calendar,
 * or to choose where to add new entries).
