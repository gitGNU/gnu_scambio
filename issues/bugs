* 2008-11-22 : Local patches seen twice on some occasions

When a program adds a patch and then lists the mdir, it sees the patch as a
transient patch. Then eventualy the patch gets synchronized and it sees it
again in the mdir log. There is currently now way to correlate the local
patch from the one received from the server.

When we receive an ack, we know what the central mdir version will be for the
patch. Actually, we store this information in the transient filename for the
client programs, but without remembering the former local version. We should
instead delete the transient file alltogether but remember the mapping from
central to local version until the patch is received, and then add in the
received patch header a field telling that this patch replaces the local
version Vl.

If this information is kept only in RAM it is lost when mdsyncc is stopped or
crash, but the likeliness of the user to see a patch twice because of this is
low enough not to bother storing the mapping in a file.
